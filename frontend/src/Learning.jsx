  // Mock health sciences content
  const healthSciencesContent = {
    "Personal Hygiene": "Personal hygiene is how you care for your body. This practice includes bathing, washing your hands, brushing your teeth, and more. Every day, you come into contact with millions of germs and viruses. They can linger on your body, and in some cases, they may make you sick. Good personal hygiene habits are directly related to less illnesses and better health.",
    "Healthy Food": "Healthy food provides your body with the nutrition it needs to function properly. A balanced diet should include fruits, vegetables, whole grains, proteins, and healthy fats. Eating healthy food helps your body grow strong, gives you energy, and helps prevent diseases.",
    "Exercise": "Exercise is any bodily activity that enhances or maintains physical fitness and overall health and wellness. Regular exercise helps strengthen muscles and bones, improve cardiovascular health, and can help maintain a healthy weight. For children, 60 minutes of physical activity daily is recommended.",
    "Rest and Sleep": "Sleep is essential for good health. During sleep, your body works to support healthy brain function and maintain your physical health. Children aged 6-12 need about 9-12 hours of sleep each night. Good sleep habits include having a regular bedtime routine and avoiding screens before bed.",
    "Numbers and Counting": "Numbers help us count things in our daily life. We count our toys, apples, and even how many steps we take! Counting helps us understand how many things we have and how they change!",
    "Basic Addition": "When we put two groups together, we get more! If you have 2 apples and I give you 3 more, now you have 5 apples. Addition helps us find the total and makes counting easier!",
  "Basic Subtraction": "When we take some things away, we have less left! If you have 4 candies and eat 2, now you only have 2. Subtraction helps us know how many things remain after taking some away!",
  "Shapes & Patterns": "Shapes are all around us, like circles, squares, and triangles. Patterns repeat, like red-blue-red-blue! Learning about shapes and patterns helps us see how things fit together!",
  "Plants and Animals": "Plants grow from seeds and need water, air, and sunlight to live. Animals like cats, dogs, birds, and fish move around and eat food. Both plants and animals are important for nature and help us in different ways!",
  "My Family": "Family is the people who love and take care of us. It includes our parents, grandparents, brothers, and sisters. Families help us, keep us safe, and make us feel happy and loved!",
  "Water and Air": "We drink water when we are thirsty, and we need air to breathe. Water helps us stay strong and healthy, and air keeps all living things alive. Without water and air, we cannot live or grow!",
  "Food and Nutrition": "Eating good food makes us strong, smart, and healthy. Fruits, vegetables, milk, and grains give us energy. Junk food is tasty but should be eaten less because it is not always good for our health!",
  "My Neighbourhood": "Our neighborhood is the area around our home where we live. It has places like schools, parks, hospitals, and shops. We meet friends, neighbors, and helpers in our neighborhood, making it a special place!",
  "Community Helpers": "Community helpers are people who work to keep us safe and happy. Teachers help us learn, doctors take care of us when we are sick, and firefighters put out fires. They make our lives better every day!",
  "Festivals": "Festivals are special days when we celebrate with family and friends. We wear new clothes, eat yummy food, and have lots of fun! Some festivals we celebrate are Diwali, Christmas, Eid, and Holi!",
  "Transport": "We use transport to go from one place to another. Cars, buses, and trains take us on roads and tracks, while boats and airplanes help us travel far. Transport makes traveling easy and fun!",
  "Place Value": "Place value helps us understand the value of each number. In 25, the 2 means twenty, and the 5 means five. Knowing place value helps us read and write numbers correctly!",
  "Adding With Carrying": "Sometimes when we add, the total is more than 9, and we need to carry over. Like 8 + 6 = 14, so we write 4 and carry over 1. Carrying helps us add big numbers easily!",
  "Subtracting with Borrowing": "When we subtract and the top number is smaller, we borrow from the next place. Like in 32 - 7, we borrow from the tens. Borrowing helps us subtract bigger numbers easily!",
  "Multiplication Basics": "Multiplication is adding the same number many times. If you have 3 groups of 2 apples, you have 6 apples in total. It helps us count faster and solve problems easily!",
  "Living and Non-living": "Living things grow, move, and need food, like people, animals, and plants. Non-living things don‚Äôt grow or eat, like chairs and rocks. Knowing the difference helps us understand our world!",
  "Plants Around Us": "Plants give us food, shade, and oxygen to breathe. Some plants are big like trees, and some are small like flowers. Taking care of plants helps keep the Earth green and healthy!",
  "Animal World": "Animals live in different places like forests, water, and farms. Some have fur, some have feathers, and some lay eggs. Every animal is special and plays a role in nature!",
  "Air and Water": "Air helps us breathe, and water keeps us hydrated. We must keep air clean and save water by not wasting it. Clean air and water help all living things stay healthy!",
  "Our Country": "Our country is where we live with our people, rules, and culture. It has a flag, a national song, and special places. Loving our country means taking care of it and respecting its people!",
  "Different Cultures": "People from different places have their own food, clothes, and celebrations. Some eat with chopsticks, some with spoons! Learning about different cultures helps us understand and respect each other.",
  "Means of Communication": "We talk, write, or use phones to share ideas. Long ago, people wrote letters, but now we use emails and messages. Communication helps us stay connected with family and friends!",
  "Important Places": "Hospitals, schools, and police stations are important places in our community. They help us learn, stay healthy, and keep us safe. We should respect and take care of these places!",
  "Germs and Diseases": "Germs are tiny living things that can make us sick. Washing hands, eating healthy, and covering our mouth when we sneeze can keep germs away. Staying clean helps us stay healthy!",
  "Healthy Habits": "Brushing teeth, eating good food, and sleeping early are healthy habits. Exercising and drinking water help us grow strong. Good habits keep us happy and full of energy!",
  "First Aid Basics": "First aid helps when someone gets hurt. Cleaning a wound and using a bandage can stop bleeding. Knowing first aid can help us take care of small injuries safely!",
  "Nutrition": "Food gives us energy and helps us grow. Fruits and vegetables are healthy, while too much candy is not. Eating the right food keeps our body strong and our mind sharp!"
